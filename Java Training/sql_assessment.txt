-- 1. Create the SQL commands that would generate the STRIKE, FIRES, and PICTURES tables.
    CREATE TABLE STRIKE (
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Date DATE,
    Time TIME,
    Lat FLOAT,
    Lon FLOAT,
    Intensity INT
);
CREATE TABLE FIRES (
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Date DATE,
    Lat FLOAT,
    Lon FLOAT,
    Area FLOAT
);
CREATE TABLE PICTURES (
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Strike_FK INT,
    Date DATE,
    Filename VARCHAR(255)
);
-- 2. Create an SQL command to generate an appropriate LIGHTNING_FIRES table that would connect 
-- the FIRES table to the STRIKE table:

CREATE TABLE LIGHTNING_FIRES (
    Strike_ID INT,
    Fire_ID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (Strike_ID) REFERENCES STRIKE(ID),
    FOREIGN KEY (Fire_ID) REFERENCES FIRES(ID)
);

-- 3. Write an SQL command that would report a single number for the average intensity for all records in the STRIKE table:

select avg(intensity) as Average_intensity from strike

-- 4. Write an SQL command that would list all STRIKE IDs for those lightning STRIKEs that do not have a picture available in the PICTURES table. Show the result set the query would generate:
select s.Id from strike s left join pictures p on s.Id = p.strike_fk where p.strike_fk is null

-- 5. Write an SQL command that would list the largest three FIRES in order of the maximum Area burned
-- by the fire.Show the result set the query would generate:

select * from fires order by area desc limit 3

-- 6. Write an SQL command to report the total Area burned by these largest three FIRES 
-- (report a single number):
select sum(area) as Total_areaBurned from (select area from fires order by area desc limit 3) 
as Largest_fire

-- 7. The lightning strike and fire occurred on the same date and
-- The lightning strike and fire occurred at the same latitude and longitude

select s.id,s.date, f.id from strike s join fires f on s.date = f.date and s.lat = f.lat and s.lon = f.lon 

-- 8. Create one or more SQL command that would fill the LIGHTNING_FIRES table you created 
-- in part 2 above with he results from your SQL query from part 7 above.

insert into lightning_fires(strike_id , fire_id) 
select strike.id as strike_id, fires.id as fire_id from strike inner join fires on strike.date = fires.date 
and strike.lat = fires.lat and strike.lon = fires.lon

-- 9. Create the result set for the following query (with headers for each column returned)
select s.lat as Latitude, s.lon as Longitude, p.filename as png 
from strike s join pictures p on s.Id = p.strike_fk order by p.filename desc 

-- 10. Write the appropriate SQL ALTER command to add a FIRE_FK attribute to the STRIKES table:

alter table strike add fire_fk int
